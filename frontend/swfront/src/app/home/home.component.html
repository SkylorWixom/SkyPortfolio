      <h2>Welcome to My Personal Site</h2>
      <p>
        My digital playground for sharing projects, honing my development skills, and documenting my progress. Here, you’ll find insights on my latest work, blog posts about tech & personal interests, and a record of my journey in software engineering. Feel free to explore and learn with me!
      
        <br><br>
        <strong>Recently Completed:</strong>I've just finished building out the site’s overall layout and integrating the backend for the Projects, Blog, and Contact 
        pages.<br>
        <strong>Next Up:</strong> I’ll be fleshing out the “Learn with Me” content and resources, where I’ll walk through various tech topics in depth.
      
        <br><br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> This site is under active construction and may change daily. Pages under “Learn with Me,” “Blog,” and “Projects” 
        reflect ideas I'm actively creating content for. My résumé is accurate, and the contact form will reach me directly. Stay tuned for further updates as the site evolves!
