            I started my professional career at Jiffy Lube when I was 16, washing windows
            and vacuuming cars. Jiffy Lube provided me with the flexibility to work
            through school as a non-traditional student. Along the way, I gained hands-on
            experience with vehicle maintenance and customer service, earning state
            inspection certifications. Within five years, I managed my own store and
            later became an assistant district manager, overseeing operations for five
            stores.
          </p>
          <p class="resume-text">
            Jiffy Lube later expanded into automotive repair, and I earned ASE
            certifications to become a master mechanic. However, I wanted more, so I
            stepped down from management to focus on my education. I completed my
            bachelor's degree in December 2021, and in February 2022, I landed my first
            full-stack developer job.

            My journey into software development began with Weber School District. I
            initially worked on an API that converted data from an outdated LANSA system
            to C# for exporting. Later, I tackled a nine-year ADA compliance audit, updating
            district and school websites to meet WCAG 2.1 standards.

          <p class="resume-text">
            Our team implemented a new student information system called PowerSchool,
            where I learned proprietary languages for custom reports, data manipulation,
            and state reporting. I also provided team training sessions, conducted code
            reviews, and gained invaluable experience collaborating in a team environment.

            I'm now finishing my master's degree in computer science at Weber State
            University. My thesis explores fault reduction in C# using Hierarchical Delta
            Debugging and the Roslyn API to manipulate syntax trees. I'm seeking new
            opportunities to learn, grow, and make a meaningful contribution in the
            software development field.
