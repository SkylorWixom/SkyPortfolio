          <h3>Career Journey</h3>
          
          <p class="education">
            I started my professional career at Jiffy Lube when I was 16, washing windows and vacuuming cars. 
            Jiffy Lube provided me with the flexibility to work through school as a non-traditional student. 
            Along the way, I gained hands-on experience with general vehicle maintenance and customer service, earning 
            state inspection certifications. I advanced to manage my own store, and within five years, I became an 
            assistant district manager, overseeing operations for five stores.
            Jiffy Lube later expanded into automotive repair, and I earned ASE certifications to become a master mechanic. 
            However, I wanted more, so I stepped down from management to focus on my education. I completed my 
            bachelor's degree in December 2021, and in February 2022, I landed my first full-stack developer job.
          </p>
          <p class="education">
            My journey into software development began with Weber School District. I initially worked on an API 
            that converted data from an outdated LANSA system to C# for exporting. Later, I tackled a nine-year-long 
            ADA compliance audit, bringing district and school websites up to WCAG 2.1 standards.
            Our team implemented a new student information system called PowerSchool, where I learned proprietary languages 
            for custom reports, data manipulation, and state reporting. I also provided team training sessions, conducted 
            code reviews, and gained invaluable experience working collaboratively in a team environment.
          </p>
          <p class="education">
            I'm now finishing my master's degree in computer science at Weber State University. My thesis explores 
            fault reduction in C# using Hierarchical Delta Debugging and the Roslyn API to manipulate syntax trees. I'm seeking new
            opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm always excited to make a meaningful contribution.
